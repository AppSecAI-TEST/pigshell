varname=<<EOH
This here's
a string most weird
where \n and \r and "quotes" and | and # this is not a comment
all other delims $foo
which would otherwise signal the end;
are allowed to proliferate
and what's more
even the EOH itself must appear at the beginning of the line
to mark the end of this here doc
EOH<<EOH
Another here doc
concatenated with the previous one
EOH
