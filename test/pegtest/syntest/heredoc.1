foo | bar <<EOH
This here's
a string most weird
where \n and \r and "quotes" and | and # this is not a comment
all other delims $foo
which would otherwise signal the end;
are allowed to proliferate
and what's more
even the EOH itself must appear at the beginning of the line
to mark the end of this here doc
EOH|grep foo | jf <<EOJF
(function()
    var y = x[1],
        z = "foo\n",
        a = 'bar';

    return z + a;
)()
EOJF | cat
