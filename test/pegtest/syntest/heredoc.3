echo <<EOH
This here's
a string most weird!
where \n and \r and "quotes" and | and # this is not a comment
all other delims $foo
which would otherwise signal the end;
are allowed to proliferate
& what's more (x*)
the EOH itself must appear at the beginning of the line
to mark the end of this here doc  [1]

x* who could've thunk?
[1] but not the pipeline or even the argument list. Unlike other shells,
here documents do not expand $variables and can be used anywhere a string
can. This makes it very easy to create arbitrary \ free text arguments
without worrying too much about what may or may not need to be escaped
EOH <<EOH
Another here document
not as verbose as the one before
EOH
