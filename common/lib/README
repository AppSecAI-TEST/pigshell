common/lib
==========

This directory holds third party libraries and files which

  * are versioned and immutable (e.g. jquery-1.7.2.js)
  * require to be accessed by an absolute URL which remains constant across
    pigshell versions (usually by iframe templates)
  * must never be deleted

While we could use public CDNs to serve out these files, having them served
out of here has two purposes:

  * Better guarantee against unavailability and mutability of external sources
  * Works with local installations even without an Internet connection

TODO

  * Assuming semantic versioning, consider providing higher-level symlinks,
    a la shared libraries. e.g. jquery-1.7.js -> jquery-1.7.2.js. This
    enables templates to use a less specific version and get automatic
    updates. May need more elaborate httpd cache rules.
